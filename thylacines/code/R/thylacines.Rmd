## Introduction
This document uses data from the [Atlas of Living Australia](http://www.ala.org.au/) to map alleged, unverified sighting of thylacines in Tasmania.

## Getting the data
Start by searching the ALA website for "thylacine" and following the [occurrences link](http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=lsid:urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:97764bed-9492-4066-a45f-e5b0c6c4280d). From the map page, download a zip file which contains occurrence data in CSV format.

Next, read the CSV file into R and select those records where _basisOfRecord_ is _HumanObservation_.

```{r get-data}
records_2016_12_01 <- read_csv("../../data/records-2016-12-01.csv")
obs <- subset(records_2016_12_01, basisOfRecord == "HumanObservation")
```

## Mapping
Fetch a map of Tasmania and overlay the observations as a density heatmap.

```{r map-data}
Tas <- get_map("Tasmania", zoom = 7, maptype = "roadmap")
Tas.map <- ggmap(Tas)
Tas.map <- Tas.map + stat_density_2d(bins = 20, geom = "polygon", size = 2, data = obs, aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, alpha = ..level.., fill = ..level..))
Tas.map <- Tas.map + scale_fill_gradient(low = "orange", high = "red", guide = FALSE) + scale_alpha(range = c(0.02, 0.8), guide = FALSE) + xlab("") + ylab("")
Tas.map
```

## Summary
Sightings are clearly concentrated in the far north-east of the state. There is also a second, less-dense diffuse region of sightings in the north-west.

Here's Wilf Batty in 1930 with the last known thylacine in the wild.

And here's "Benjamin" in 1933, the last known thylacine anywhere who died in 1936.

There is no evidence other than alleged sightings (_e.g._ scats, roadkill, DNA) to suggest that thylacines still live in Tasmania. But we would like to believe.
